***<h1>Hinglish Translation Model</h1>***
This repository contains a simple Hinglish (Hindi-English mix) translation model. The model translates English sentences into Hinglish using a dictionary-based approach.

***<h2>Table of Contents</h2>***
1. Requirements
2. Usage
3. Performance Evaluation



***<h2>Requirements</h2>***
To run the Hinglish translation model, you'll need:

Python 3.x
sys library for setting console encoding to UTF-8


***<h2>Usage</h2>***
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Run the python code
3. See the output in the terminal section

   
***<h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>***
The model's performance can be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* Accuracy: The extent to which the translated text matches the intended meaning of the original sentence.

* Fluency: How natural and coherent the Hinglish translation sounds.

* Understandability: How clear and easy to understand the Hinglish translation is, especially for non-native Hindi speakers.

* Speed: Speed can be checked in the terminal when the code is executed. It shows the speed as well.

You can assess these aspects by examining the translated output and comparing it to the original English sentence. You may also collect feedback from users to further evaluate the model's performance.

Feel free to modify the translations dictionary (translations) to add more words or phrases for improved accuracy and fluency.

This README provides a basic guide on how to run the model and evaluate its performance. You can customize it further based on your specific project needs.
